## Reporting Bugs via Issues

Encountering a bug can be frustrating, but your reports help us improve. Here's how you can report a bug effectively:

1. **Search Existing Issues**: Before creating a new issue, please check if the bug has already been reported. If it has, you can add more information to the existing report instead of starting a new one.

## Suggesting Translations and Fixes via Pull Requests

If you're fluent in another language or have identified a fix for an issue, here's how you can contribute through pull requests:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository. This creates a copy of the project under your GitHub account, allowing you to make changes without affecting the original.

2. **Make Your Changes**: Work on your translations or fixes in your forked repository. Ensure that your changes are clear and concise. For translations, maintain the context and tone of the original text.

3. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes with a clear message describing what you've modified. For example, "Add French translation for README" or "Fix login bug."

4. **Create a Pull Request**: Once you're ready, create a pull request to merge your changes into the original repository. Provide a descriptive title and a detailed description of your contributions. Link any relevant issues.

5. **Review Process**: The repository maintainers will review your pull request. They may suggest changes or ask for additional details. Once approved, your changes will be merged.
